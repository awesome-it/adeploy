# adeploy

<!-- --8<-- [start:intro] -->

We build `adeploy`, an universal deployment tool for Kubernetes that supports rendering and deployment of lightweight 
Jinja templated k8s manifests and also Helm charts. 

Weâ€™ve added support for ... 

* using **Jinja variables** from per cluster, namespaces or release configuration 
* easy **secret management** based on [Gopass](https://github.com/gopasspw/gopass) or other command line based password managers
* running deployment tests in **CI/CD pipelines**
* **previewing** and **patching** upstream [Helm Charts](https://artifacthub.io/) before deploying
* **extending** upstream Helm Charts with custom Jinja-templates manifests
* handy templating for **labels, annotations, probes, resource limits** and other metadata

... and even more to make your daily work with k8s easier.

## Getting Started

<!-- --8<-- [start:install] -->

You can find `adeploy` on [GitHub](https://github.com/awesome-it/adeploy). But it is recommended to install 
or upgrade [adeploy](https://pipy.org/project/adeploy) using `pip`:

```shell
$ pip install adeploy
```

Or use [pipx](https://github.com/pypa/pipx) to install, upgrade and run `adeploy` in an isolated environment:

```shell
$ pipx install adeploy
$ pipx upgrade adeploy
```

You should now be able to run `adeploy` from the command line:

```shell
adeploy --help
```

You can now start to use `adeploy`.
