# Quickstart

## Install

You can find `adeploy` on [GitHub](https://github.com/awesome-it/adeploy). But it is recommended to install 
or upgrade [adeploy](https://pipy.org/project/adeploy) using `pip`:

```shell
$ pip install adeploy
```

Or use [pipx](https://github.com/pypa/pipx) to install, upgrade and run `adeploy` in an isolated environment:

```shell
$ pipx install adeploy
$ pipx upgrade adeploy
```

You should now be able to run `adeploy` from the command line:

```shell
adeploy --help
```

You can now start to use `adeploy`. If you're new to `adeploy` continue to read [howto use `adeploy`](usage.md).
