# About

We build `adeploy`, an universal deployment tool for Kubernetes that supports rendering and deployment of lightweight 
Jinja templated k8s manifests and also Helm charts. 

Weâ€™ve added support for ... 

* using **Jinja variables** from per cluster, namespaces or release configuration 
* easy **secret management** based on [Gopass](https://github.com/gopasspw/gopass) or other command line based password managers
* running deployment tests in **CI/CD pipelines**
* **previewing** and **patching** upstream [Helm Charts](https://artifacthub.io/) before deploying
* **extending** upstream Helm Charts with custom Jinja-templates manifests
* handy templating for **labels, annotations, probes, resource limits** and other metadata

... and even more to make your daily work with Kubernetes easier.

## Examples

This is how you can render, test (preview) and deploy a Helm Chart:
