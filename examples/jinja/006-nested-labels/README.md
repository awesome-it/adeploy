# General Structure

This is a Jinja based `adeploy` project that includes:

* namespace `playground`,
* two releases: `prod`, `test` and  
* a deployment that is using 
  * a global label configuration and
  * best practise labels generated by `adeploy`. 

Deploy as follows:

```
$ kubectl create namespace playground
$ adeploy -p jinja [-n <name>] render .
$ adeploy -p jinja [-n <name>] test
$ adeploy -p jinja [-n <name>] deploy
```

By default `adeploy` is using the project folder as deployment name (i.e. `005-labels`). 
If you want to use another deployment name, pass it with `-n <name>`.
